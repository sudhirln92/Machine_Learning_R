OBJECTIVE:
Prediction of likelihood of survival in Titanic shipwrecks.
INTRODUCTION:
Sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.In this challenge, we are doing the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.
SCOPE OF PROJECT:
Using machine learning techniques we can predict the likelihood of survival in such major disaster, which can lead to have precautions in future ship events.  We have taken historical data of 900 passengers along with several parameters which are given below.
