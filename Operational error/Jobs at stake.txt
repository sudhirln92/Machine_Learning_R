�Jobs at stake � can you please help?� 


�ABC Bank� is one of the oldest and reputed banks. The top management is not happy 
with the performance of the Operations department because of the operational errors 
committed in the critical processes and as well other performance metrics. A cross functional 
team was formed and mandated to address the issue ASAP since the management felt if it did 
not, the processes would have to be outsourced to a third party which means hundreds of 
employees within the bank would lose their jobs. The team collected the data for 6 months on 
various factors including age, educational qualification, location of processing etc... (vide excel 
file titled �Operational error.xls�). 

The team did interview the Operations team at all levels and encountered a lot of theories 
surrounding the performance. They were quite confused about the way to proceed. You are 
supposed to get started immediately since the data was already collected and ready for 
analysis. Indicate clearly the tests you have undertaken to tests various hypothesis 

(Assume level of significance level to be 5%) 

Study the relationship between errors and the experience of employees, production effort and 
the overtime. Model the relationship to understand in detail and provide your 
recommendations 

Use R-programming for analysing the data. 

 

Remember hundreds of jobs at stake � you have to help! 

 

------- All the best! -------
