# Operational Error
Optimize revenue by finding operational error in production of controllers. The logistic regression as the dependent variable was following binomial distribution. That is Fault or Non-Fault, logistic regression was used. There were about 1500 observations having past fault history.

The various process followed such as 
1. Data Treatment 
2. Data Exploration 
3. Data Modeling 
4. Data Validation 
5. Data Model Assumption 
6. Feasibility of model.

The data is also analysed the same data by using Decision Tree and Random Forest. The tested the model by Cross
Validation for over fitting / under fitting, used Confusion Matrix, ROC curve and AUC for Model Performance measure.
